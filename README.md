# BachelorThesis_Code
The code used for the data collection of the bachelor thesis project regarding the implementation of Argon2 into the Hashcash algorithm.

#CUDA
If the cuda code should for some reason be corrupted, it can simply be redownloaded from: https://github.com/WebDollar/argon2-gpu/

The script hashrate_argon_gpu.sh was created to simplify the usage of the CUDA benchmarking tool. Furthermore it can be used to easily create CSV files from the data gathered by using said benchmarking tool
